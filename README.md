# cyberbully
I worked on a project called Cyberbullying Detection using Machine Learning and Speech Interface. The aim of this project was to identify harmful or abusive language in both text and speech input. I used natural language processing to process the input, trained machine learning models to detect bullying-related content, and integrated a speech recognition system so users can speak instead of typing. This makes the tool more accessible, especially for mobile or voice-first platforms. The goal is to help create safer digital spaces by detecting and addressing cyberbullying early. Thank you!"
